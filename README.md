# Copy Replay ID Readme

This mod introduces a text box on the left-hand side of the replays browser. Upon selecting a game from the list its direct lobby ID will be put into the box. You can select and copy this ID for ease of sharing replays.

To use the ID simply paste it in the search box. You will find the game recognises this as a Direct Lobby ID and you can launch the replay.
